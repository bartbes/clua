Concentrated lua (aka clua) is a small launcher that allows you to pack your
lua up into a zip, append it to clua, and run it standalone.

Building
--------

Building clua is easy, just follow these steps:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

Usage
-----

Using clua is easy as well, you zip up all of your lua files, and
append it to the executables, like this:

	cat clua my.zip > my.bin
	chmod +x my.bin

Clua will require ".", so this means at the top of your zip file (so not
in a folder), you will have to have an init.lua.
